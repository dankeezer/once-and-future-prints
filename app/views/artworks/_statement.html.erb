      <p>I am fascinated by craft; the rules represent nearly scientific truths.  A stitch done in such a way produces a particular fabric, a particular material acts particularly under particular circumstances.  All these rules accumulate over generations to present a tradition that you can rely on to remain constant for a reliable process and product.  However, consistency of product is not part of my craft-fantasy for painting: where is the intelligence?</p>
 
      <p>This current body of work investigates how intuition and intellect are knit together in the act of painting-and-rule-making through the expressive brushstroke and the precision of drawing.  The work provides a space for the repetitive and reliable aspects of craft, the tracing steadily revealing the architecture of each brushstroke. I want the project to occur in a logical and sensitive way, employing the rules of craft, while still maintaining the inquisitive rigor of expression and discovery in painting.</p>
